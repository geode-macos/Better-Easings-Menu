# Better Easings Menu

Mod that replaces the current easing menu in triggers with a better one.

If you're looking for a mod that provides animation previews, check out [Better Easing Select](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/nwo5.better_easing_select) by Nwo5. However, I'll note that there are some triggers which it has not yet added support for as of writing.
